# Gestalt
Tired of being added to a group every time you breath, for some activity that barely lasts a day? Maybe this will help you!  
Gestalt is a file and text sharing platform for quick collaboration. 

## Features
- No sign-in required
- Invite anyone online
- Only those who have the invite can enter the session

## Hosting tips
- To start frontend or backend : `npm run dev`
- Change backend address in info.js

## Issues
- For the session to continue existing, atleast 1 user must be in it at all times. Otherwise it self-distructs.
- Works well on computers, but takes some time to disconnect on mobiles when the browser is minimised.

Open to suggestions!
